# trade-corner

Cron script to perform trades in Pokémon Crystal, based on Háčky's original findings on [Glitch City](https://archives.glitchcity.info/forums/board-76/thread-7509/page-0.html) - search for "PokéCom Center Trade Corner".

## Setup

Create `config.json` using the example file provided.

This script should be run as a cronjob, as it will exit once it's completed; we recommend doing it once per hour (as the game itself wont let a user check before an hour has passed).
